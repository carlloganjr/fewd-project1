      <h2>Hiking</h2>
      <p>I enjoy hiking through nature.  I spent a lot of weekends and vaction exploring the national parks from the east coast to the west coast.  Utah has some of the best national park and state parks.  I spent many hours getting lost in Bell Canyon near Salt Lake City.</p>
      <p>I'm planning to explore more of the parks in the Pacific Northwest this summer and fall.</p>

      <h2>Travel</h2>
      <p>For about two years my wife and I have traveled the US living in different cities while exploring various regions.  We learned more about our country traveling than we ever did reading books.  Our terrain is vast and our history is epic. Traveling has broadened my views and I will always appreciate that I had the chance to travel as much as I have.</p>

      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>From the moment I picked up a 35mm Pentax K1000 I've loved this hobby the most.  Its being the one I go to for clearing my mind or relaxing.  I've had my photographs in individual and group exhibitions.</p>
      <p>Traveling has given me plenty of great subject to photograph and I look forward to discovering more as I continue on the journey through the US.</p>

      <h2>Art and Design</h2>
      <p>I've been drawing for as long as I can remember.  Art and creativety were always something I loved as an activity.  I followed that passion into a graphic design career for the first decade of my adult life.</p>
      <p>Now I hope to use the passion I has for design as a favorable skill in front end web development. </p>
